# Stargate Retro

<img src="screenshots/Screenshot%202025-05-07%20154406.png" alt="drawing" width="400"/>

HTML Webpages recreated and inspired by computers and UI in the stargate show. I have taken some liberties and made changes that make sense to me and to better integrate with StargateSoftware_V4. 

Please submit bugs and I will fix them when I have time. New features will be based on what I feel like making but I'm open to suggestions.

- New Pages
    - Dialing from S1
    - Address Book from S2E15 - The Fifth Race
    - Base Power Monitor
    - Malp
    - Popups

        - Self Destruct

## Webhooks

If you don't use [StargateProject-Software](https://github.com/jonnerd154/StargateProject-software) or your name is *Micha≈Ç* you can setup this project using webhooks. I have added enough to get started - but probably won't add more features because at that point I'm basically rewriting the github project this is meant to expand on.

To setup with webhooks:
1. Set `USE_WEBHOOKS` to `True` in server.py
2. Update `PROXY_BASE_URL`, this is where POST requests like `/do/dhd_press` will be sent
    - There is an optional `pre_post_hook` method in webhooks.py where you can perform extra actions such as adding the dhd press symbol to the address_buffer_outgoing without needing to make an extra api call.
3. Run: `python server.py`
4. Open URL: `http://localhost:5000/retro/dial.html`

The stargate state that is normally returned from StargateProject-Software is emulated in `webhooks.py`. get_data should already be setup with all the GET requests that my UI needs. You can modify `set_data` and `pre_post_hook` to add any extra functionality may be needed for your stargate.

Example Webhook Dialing Process:
```
POST /sgc/set/dialing_status {"address_buffer_outgoing": [11]}
...
POST /sgc/set/dialing_status {"address_buffer_outgoing": [11,9,18]}
...
POST /sgc/set/dialing_status {"address_buffer_outgoing": [11,9,18,19], "locked_chevrons_outgoing": 1}
...
POST /sgc/set/dialing_status {"address_buffer_outgoing": [11,9,18,19, 20], "locked_chevrons_outgoing": 2}
...
POST /sgc/set/dialing_status {"locked_chevrons_outgoing": 4}
...
POST /sgc/set/dialing_status {"locked_chevrons_outgoing": 5}
...
POST /sgc/set/dialing_status {"address_buffer_outgoing": [11,9,18,19,20,25,1]}
...
POST /sgc/set/dialing_status {"locked_chevrons_outgoing": 7}
...
POST /sgc/set/dialing_status {"wormhole_active": true, "connected_planet": "PJ2-445"}
...
POST /sgc/action/close_wormhole {}
```

# Development

Instead of pixels or percentages, the css is defined in terms of vmin. This allows creating a ui at a fixed square aspect ratio that can scale. Update the vmin value in the respective scss file. The scss file has a function to generate a clamp forcing a max size for the entire UI.

To generate css run: `sass --watch scss:retro/css`

For a basic web server to proxy the stargate software run: `python server.py`
