# Stargate Retro

<img src="screenshots/Screenshot%202025-05-07%20154406.png" alt="drawing" width="400"/>

HTML Webpages recreated and inspired by computers and UI in the stargate show. I have taken some liberties and made changes that make sense to me and to better integrate with StargateSoftware_V4. 

Please submit bugs and I will fix them when I have time. New features will be based on what I feel like making but I'm open to suggestions.

Once installed you can update some of the *.css and *.js files with customizations such as different colors or updated text. See [below](#customizations) for customizations. (More to come later)

Navigation header at the top of all pages to integrate with v4 software. As it is not fully integrated with the v4 software you will not be able to get back to my pages (from the original UI) without a direct link.

## Future Plans?

- Code Updates:
    - Convert javascript to typescript
        - Depending on integration with v4 software it may be easier to stick with js
    - OR Update javascript with jquery
- New Pages
    - Dialing from S1
    - Address Book from S2E15 - The Fifth Race
    - Malp
    - Popups
        - System Access Denied
        - Self Destruct
    - Add IRIS animation and control
- Add loading screen
    - Like a old DOS computer booting up
    - Could be used to hide initial API calls while applying customizations
- Support for other languages?
    - That will wreak havoc on the page layout

## Webhooks

If you don't use [StargateProject-Software](https://github.com/jonnerd154/StargateProject-software) or your name is *Micha≈Ç* you can setup this project using webhooks. I have added enough to get started - but probably won't add more features because at that point I'm basically rewriting the github project this is meant to expand on.

To setup with webhooks:
1. Set `USE_WEBHOOKS` to `True` in server.py
2. Update `PROXY_BASE_URL`, this is where POST requests like `/do/dhd_press` will be sent
    - There is an optional `pre_post_hook` method in webhooks.py where you can perform extra actions such as adding the dhd press symbol to the address_buffer_outgoing without needing to make an extra api call.
3. Run: `python server.py`
4. Open URL: `http://localhost:5000/retro/dial.html`

The stargate state that is normally returned from StargateProject-Software is emulated in `webhooks.py`. get_data should already be setup with all the GET requests that my UI needs. You can modify `set_data` and `pre_post_hook` to add any extra functionality may be needed for your stargate.

Example Webhook Dialing Process:
```
POST /sgc/set/dialing_status {"address_buffer_outgoing": [11]}
...
POST /sgc/set/dialing_status {"address_buffer_outgoing": [11,9,18]}
...
POST /sgc/set/dialing_status {"address_buffer_outgoing": [11,9,18,19], "locked_chevrons_outgoing": 1}
...
POST /sgc/set/dialing_status {"address_buffer_outgoing": [11,9,18,19, 20], "locked_chevrons_outgoing": 2}
...
POST /sgc/set/dialing_status {"locked_chevrons_outgoing": 4}
...
POST /sgc/set/dialing_status {"locked_chevrons_outgoing": 5}
...
POST /sgc/set/dialing_status {"address_buffer_outgoing": [11,9,18,19,20,25,1]}
...
POST /sgc/set/dialing_status {"locked_chevrons_outgoing": 7}
...
POST /sgc/set/dialing_status {"wormhole_active": true, "connected_planet": "PJ2-445"}
...
POST /sgc/action/close_wormhole {}
```

# Development

Instead of pixels or percentages, the css is defined in terms of vmin. This allows creating a ui at a fixed square aspect ratio that can scale. Update the vmin value in the respective scss file. The scss file has a function to generate a clamp forcing a max size for the entire UI.

To generate css run: `sass --watch scss:retro/css`

For a basic web server to proxy the stargate software run: `python server.py`

Easiest to develop just using vmin then convert to vmin-clamp() after. Find regex `([-0-9.]+)vmin` and replace `vmin-clamp($1)`
